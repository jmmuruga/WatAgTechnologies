      </div>
      <p class="mb-3">
        M/s Green Solutions India, in collaboration with their sister concern
        M/s ByteScape Labs India, has developed the technology for IIoT based
        Sewage Treatment Plants (STPs). IoT technology and its application in
        the industrial scenario offers a host of operational advantages.
        Foremost among them is the facility to remotely monitor the operation of
        the STPs over the Internet, even though the plant itself may be located
        at the outskirts of human settlements. This can greatly mitigate human
        exposure and frequent travel issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        We present here a live demo of a IIoT-based model plant which
        incorporates some of the features of a typical STP. The demo plant is a
        scaled down version which includes two pumps and its associated control
        panel. This would be a single module of a full-fledged functional STP.
      </p>
      <p class="my-1">
        <span class="font-semibold mr-2">Description:</span>In this plant, there
        are two pumps, each of 1 HP rating. They are labelled as Pump1 and Pump2
        respectively in Figure 1.
      </p>

        <p>
          They can be run alternately as in a typical STP. They can be run in
          “Auto” mode without human intervention or in “Manual” mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pumps pump water from one tank to another alternatively.
          Water-level controllers are also installed.
        </p>
        <p>
          The pump motors are protected by individual overload relays and the
          system has phase failure protection. In addition, there is a mode
          selector switch to select between auto and manual mode.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is a selector switch to select between Pump1 and Pump2 in Manual
          mode. In the Auto mode, the pumps are run in a cyclic fashion, running
          alternately. In each cycle, the ON state is triggered by a timer.
          Thereafter, a water-level controller turns off the pump when the
          delivery tank is full.

          The block diagram in Figure 1 consists of an electrical block which
          provides electric power and electrical protection and switching
          circuits for the pumps. This electrical block takes care of the
          regular plant operation. From this block two sets of signals are
